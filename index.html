    <p>As the state of New York continues to suffer the consequences of the opioid epidemic, opioid-related deaths experienced a significant surge across the state in the two decades between 2003 and 2020, according to <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Vital-Statistics-Opioid-Related-Deaths-by-Age-Grou/qabx-2sqw/about_data" target="_blank">data</a> from the New York State Department of Health. </p>

        <p>The data indicated a general upward trend in opioid-related deaths over the past two decades, with a significantly sharp increase of approximately 42% between 2019 and 2020. The data contributes to the wide variety of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/data/index.html" target="_blank">research</a> showing a substantial opioid crisis in New York and across the country. </p>

        <p>Evan Frost, the assistant director of communications and public information at NY’s Office of Addiction Services and Supports, said it is critical that New York state continue to expand its overdose prevention resources to combat the worsening epidemic. </p>

        <blockquote>“The current overdose epidemic is the worst on record, and we need to do all that we can to keep people alive,” Frost wrote.</blockquote>

        <p>Demographically, the data reflects that the opioid epidemic has been largely a white and male phenomenon over the past two decades. Although nationally Black Americans were impacted at nearly a five-fold greater <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9447354/" target="_blank">rate</a> by opioid deaths than their white counterparts in 2020, the non-Hispanic white population disproportionately suffered from opioid-related deaths in NY state.</p>

        <p>In the years between 2003 and 2020, nearly 22,000 white non-Hispanic New Yorker’s died of opioid-related deaths, over four times more than hispanic New Yorker’s – the second most affected population in the state. </p>

        <p>The demographic disparity is predominantly driven by opioid regulation and marketing, which often gives white Americans unrivaled access to opioids compared to other groups, coordinator of Syracuse University’s addiction studies program Dessa Bergen-Cico said. </p>

        <p>In line with the rest of the country, however, men were 2.5 times more likely to suffer from an opioid-related death compared to women. National data shows that men die due to overdose at a <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/men-died-overdose-2-3-times-greater-rate-women-us-2020-2021" target="_blank">rate</a> 2-3 times greater than women in the U.S. </p>

        <p>Although it has been <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/substance-use-in-women/sex-gender-differences-in-substance-use" target="_blank">established</a> that men have higher drug usage rates than women, researchers have discovered that this alone cannot <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/men-died-overdose-2-3-times-greater-rate-women-us-2020-2021" target="_blank">explain</a> the wide gender-gap in overdose deaths. They observed that a combination of biological, behavioral and social elements likely contribute to the elevated mortality risk for men.</p>

        <p>Opioid-related deaths have also increased substantially for both men and women over the past two decades. For men, the number of deaths rose from 570 to 3103, a 444% increase. Women experienced a slightly larger surge, with deaths rising from 197 to 1102, nearly a 460% increase.</p>

        <p>Bergen-Cico attributed the rising death rate to a “plateau” in progress being made around overdose prevention and increased contamination of fentanyl and xylazine — which makes drug use significantly more lethal. </p>

        <p>Although the data collected by the NYSDH stops in 2020, more recent data sources show that the opioid crisis has continued to worsen into 2023.</p>

        <p>According to data from NY’s OASAS, the opioid overdose death rate has quadrupled in the last decade with preliminary data showing more than <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-all-192-million-first-year-opioid-settlement-funds-allocated-serve#:~:text=Preliminary%20data%20show%20more%20than,three%2Dquarters%20of%20those%20deaths." target="_blank">6,300</a> overdose deaths in NY state in 2022, with opioids involved in more than three-quarters of those deaths. </p>

        <blockquote>“The opioid epidemic continues to impact every community across New York and fighting the epidemic includes equipping individuals, communities, organizations and agencies with the right tools,” Cadence Acquaviva, a public information officer with the NYSDH, wrote.</blockquote>

        <p>As the opioid crisis has worsened, various health organizations across the state and country — including New York State’s OASAS — have dedicated money and resources towards prevention and harm reduction resources to mitigate the rise in opioid-related deaths. </p>

        <p>Among these resources, one of the most effective and widely utilized is naloxone training, coordinator of Onondaga County Health Department’s Substance Use Initiative Mariah Senecal-Reilly said. <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/naloxone" target="_blank">Naloxone</a> — more commonly known by one of its brand names, Narcan — blocks and reverses the effects of opioids in the nervous system and has been credited for saving the lives of <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/health/2023/09/narcan-now-available-over-the-counter-in-central-ny-how-to-get-lifesaving-overdose-drug.html#:~:text=More%20than%20100%20people%20die,receive%20the%20drug%20in%20time." target="_blank">75%</a> or more of people who receive the drug in time.</p>

        <p>Other harm reduction strategies include increased access to fentanyl and xylazine testing strips, funding drug user support programs and supporting community based organizations who work directly in communities impacted by the opioid epidemic, Acquaviva said. </p>


<p>On a national level, the Biden administration has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/briefing-room/2023/09/01/icymi-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-announces-450m-to-support-president-bidens-unity-agenda-efforts-to-beat-the-overdose-epidemic-save-lives/" target="_blank">announced</a> a $450 million effort in September 2023 to expand overdose prevention strategies to combat fentanyl and other opioid overdoses that kill more than 100,000 Americans each year. Biden also declared Aug. 7 through Sept. 2 as a federal Overdose Awareness Week. </p>

<p>“(The nation will) reaffirm our commitment to beating this public health and public safety epidemic in memory of all those we have lost and to protect all the lives we can still save,” President Biden wrote in the press release.</p>

<p> Senecal-Reilly believes that prevention initiatives like these, on both the national and community levels, are vital to save lives and combat the opioid crisis.</p>

<p>“You would be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn’t have a connection to an overdose or a family member who uses drugs and having resources available for the community at large gives them the ability to feel empowered to help somebody,” Senecal-Reilly said. </p>
